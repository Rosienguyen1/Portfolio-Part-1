# Introductory Document - Portfolio 1
### Dataset Overview
This portfolio utilizes a car sales dataset containing essential information on various aspects of each vehicle, including brand, type, fuel type, transmission, and ownership history. The primary focus is on predicting the selling price as the target variable. By identifying the features that most significantly impact car prices, this analysis aims to build a model capable of accurately predicting the selling price for new, unseen vehicles.

### Objective
This analysis aims to handle raw data with missing values and outliers to ensure data quality and reliability. By exploring the dataset’s patterns and examining the relationships between features—particularly those influencing the selling price—this project seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of market dynamics. The analysis leverages descriptive techniques to uncover valuable insights into the car market, ultimately enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions. Furthermore, multiple visualization types are employed to enhance the interpretability of the findings, making the results more accessible and useful.

### Applied Techniques
The primary technique used in this analysis is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), which involves exploring, summarizing, and visualizing the dataset to uncover insights. Through EDA, patterns in the data are identified, offering a clearer understanding of the car market from both the seller's and buyer's perspectives. Additionally, the matplotlib library is utilized to create visually informative plots that make the insights derived from the data easy to understand and interpret.

### How to Run this Project
To run this project, start by importing the car sales dataset into Jupyter Notebook. Begin the data cleaning process by addressing any missing values, either by dropping columns with excessive missing data or filling in where possible to maintain data integrity. Review unique values in each column to familiarize yourself with the dataset’s structure and check for inconsistencies. Next, conduct a descriptive analysis to observe patterns and relationships among features, especially those related to selling price. Utilize the matplotlib library to create visualizations that illustrate the data’s insights effectively. Finally, detect and remove any outliers as needed to enhance the model’s accuracy. The project concludes with a summary of key findings, offering a clear perspective on the trends and factors influencing car prices.

### Key Takeaways
When selecting a car, consumers should prioritize features that contribute to long-term value and reliability. Investing in reputable brands can ensure quality and durability, while the choice of transmission type may affect driving convenience and access to advanced technologies. Lower mileage typically correlates with fewer unexpected repairs and a longer vehicle lifespan. Additionally, understanding a car’s ownership history provides insights into its maintenance and condition. Ultimately, aligning vehicle features with personal needs helps consumers make informed and worthwhile purchases.
